## Abstraction

Humans are curious in nature. However it is impossible for us to know every single thing that is going on.

The same is valid when designing software. More even when working in team on larger projects. It is not practical to know every little detail that is going on. It's impossible, impractical and even too time-consuming. There is actually no good reason why you should try to know every detail.

When working on projects at a certain level, it is a good idea to apply the concept of abstraction.
