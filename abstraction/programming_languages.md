## Programming Languages provide Abstractions

All programming languages provide abstractions. The actual quality of the abstractions will determine the complexity of the problem you are able to solve. Try writing an MMORPG game using nothing but assembler.

In fact assembly language is an abstraction for machine code which is an abstraction of the actual hardware of a computer system. Which is an abstraction of the electrons moving around.

Many imperative languages that followed (such as Fortran, C, Pascal, ...) were another level of abstraction introduced on top of the assembly language. So basically a computer application is nothing but layer upon layer upon layer of abstraction.
