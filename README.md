# Object Oriented Thinking

This will be a short-course on object oriented thinking, introducing all sorts of concepts involving object oriented programming.

This course should cover the whole OOP or even better OOT concept from basic things like objects, classes and composition to inheritance and interfaces.

The goal is to be completely language independent. That is where UML (Unified Modeling Language) might come into play.

May god be with us all.
